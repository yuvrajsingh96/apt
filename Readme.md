# Digital Rights Management (DRM) Smart Contract

## Vision

The Digital Rights Management (DRM) project aims to provide a decentralized platform for managing and enforcing digital rights for content creators. By using blockchain technology, content creators can securely register their digital assets, set usage prices, and provide access to consumers in a transparent, immutable way. The platform ensures fair compensation for creators while offering secure access to content for users.

## Features

- **Register Digital Content**: Content creators can register their digital content on the blockchain, specifying a unique identifier and usage price.
- **Usage Rights Request**: Users can request usage rights to the registered content, ensuring proper usage while protecting the creator's intellectual property.
- **Transparent Ownership**: Content ownership and rights are stored transparently on the blockchain, providing proof of authenticity and clear ownership.

## Contract Address

- **Network**: Aptos Mainnet/Testnet
- **Contract Address**: `0xb689e9305b136038be32db2bb9df6744f65fdd5761bdde59502cd883082df3b3` (Replace with the actual contract address once deployed)

## How It Works

1. **Register Content**:

   - Content creators call the `register_content` function to register their digital assets.
   - The function takes the content ID and usage price as parameters and stores the content information on the blockchain.

2. **Request Usage Rights**:
   - Users call the `request_usage` function to request usage rights for the content.
   - The function checks if the content ID matches the one specified by the creator.
   - In future iterations, payment logic will be implemented to ensure that usage rights are granted only after payment is fulfilled.

## Future Scope

- **Payment Integration**: Implement payment handling so that users must pay the usage fee to gain access to the content.
- **Access Control Mechanism**: Add an access control feature that automatically grants or denies access to digital content based on whether the user has paid the usage fee.
- **Royalty Distribution**: Introduce royalty distribution to allow content creators to earn royalties whenever their content is reused or resold.
- **Usage Tracking**: Enable tracking of how and when content is accessed to ensure that all uses comply with the rights granted by the creator.
- **NFT Integration**: Integrate NFTs to represent unique digital content, ensuring that ownership and rights can be transferred seamlessly.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies for the Aptos blockchain.
- Deploy the contract using your preferred deployment tool.
- Once deployed, content creators can register their digital content, and users can request usage rights through the smart contract functions.
